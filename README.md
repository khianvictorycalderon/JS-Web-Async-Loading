# Async Loading and Data Fetch Example

This project demonstrates an asynchronous loading process that progresses from 0% to 100%. After the loading completes, it simulates fetching some data asynchronously and displays the fetched data.

## How It Works

1. **Loading Process**: The page shows a loading percentage that increases from 0% to 100% at intervals.
2. **Async Data Fetch**: Once the loading reaches 100%, the script simulates a data fetching operation (e.g., using `setTimeout`) and displays the fetched data after a short delay.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. The page will show a loading progress bar, and once completed, it will display some fetched data.
